Hierarchical Bayesian State Trace Analysis

This repository aims to compare a few different methods of conducting an STA. As such, it includes some code from both [Kalish, M. L., Dunn, J. C., Burdakov, O. P., & Sysoev, O. (2016). A statistical test of the equality of latent orders. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 70, 1-11.](https://github.com/michaelkalish/STA) and [Davis-Stober, C. P., Morey, R.
